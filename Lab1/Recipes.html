					<td>Barbecue Chicken with Succotash</td>
					<td>chicken breasts, ketchup, frozen corn, frozen baby lima beans, garlic, unsalted butter, Worcestershire sauce</td>
					<td>
						1. Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the skin is golden and crisp, about 30 minutes.
						2. Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Combine the cider, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon mustard in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.
						3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the scallion whites, bell pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water, the corn, lima beans and the remaining 1 teaspoon mustard. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the scallion greens.
						4. Turn on the broiler. Brush the chicken with the prepared barbecue sauce and broil until the sauce is thick and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Serve with the succotash.

					<td>Instant Pot Salmon with Garlic Potatoes and Greens</td>
					<td>salmon fillets, ketchup, paprika, pepper, garlic, unsalted butter, arugula, potatoes</td>
					<td>
						1. Put the potatoes in the bottom of an Instant Pot. Add 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons of the butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the pot's steam rack over the potatoes.
						2. Rub the top and sides of the salmon fillets with the paprika and lemon zest and season generously with salt and pepper. Place skin-side down on the rack. Put on the lid, making sure the steam valve is in the sealing position, and set the cooker to high pressure for 3 minutes. When finished, carefully turn the steam valve to the venting position to release the pressure.
						3. Remove the salmon and rack and set the cooker to saute at normal heat. When the potatoes start sizzling, add the garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes; stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and season generously with salt and pepper. Smash the potatoes with a fork or wooden spoon until chunky.
						4. Turn off the cooker. Add the mixed greens to the potatoes and stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the salmon and potato mixture among plates. Serve with lemon wedges.
